## Procedure to Determine the Concentration of Chloride Ions

**Follow these steps to determine the concentration of chloride ions in a sample:**

1. Pipette out 20 ml of water sample into a clean and dry conical flask.  
2. To this solution add 2 drops of 2% K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> indicator.  
3. Fill the burette with N/100 AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution and note down the initial reading as indicated by the lower meniscus.  
4. Titrate the reaction mixture against N/100 AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution. During titration, the color of the solution changes from yellow to reddish brown. Continue the titration until no further color change is observed in the reaction mixture — this volume is the endpoint.  
5. Repeat the titration to obtain concordant values.

## Safety Precautions

1. Clamp the burette vertically.  
2. Before use, rinse the burette thoroughly; ensure no air bubbles are present in the burette while filling.  
3. Remove the funnel after filling the burette.  
4. Read the lower meniscus of the burette.  
5. During titration, continuously stir the titration flask.  
6. To improve visibility of the color change at the endpoint, place a sheet of white filter paper beneath the conical flask.  
7. Add the same amount of indicator in each titration.
