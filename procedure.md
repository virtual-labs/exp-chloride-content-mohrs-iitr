Follow these steps to determine the concentration of chloride ions in a sample:

1.Pipette out 20 ml of the water sample into a clean and dry conical flask.  
2. To this solution add 2 drops of 2% K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> indicator.  
3.Fill the burette with N/100 AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution and note down the initial reading as indicated by the lower meniscus.  
4.Titrate the reaction mixture against N/100 AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution; during titration the color of the solution changes from yellow to reddish brown. Continue the titration until no further change in color is observed in the color of reaction mixture, this volume is measured as the end point.  
5.The titration is repeated for concordant values.  

#### **Slide-1 Procedure**
1.Add few drops of potassium Chromate indicator into sample water.<br/>
2.The colour changes to yellow.

#### **Slide-2 Procedure**
1.Set the normality of titrate(Silver Nitrate solution) and volume of titrant(Sample water solution) start button.<br/>
2.Fix the nozzle opening size by nozzle open slider.Shake the flask while Titrating.<br/>
3.Titrate the solution till it turn to brick-red colour.

#### **Safety Precautions**

1.Clamp the burette vertically.  
2.Before use rinse the burette thoroughly, while filling the burette no air bubble should be in the burette.  
3.After filling of the burette remove the funnel.  
4.Read the lower meniscus of the burette.  
5.During titration, the titration flask should be continuously stirred.  
6. To get better visibility of the color change at the end point, use filter paper below the conical flask.  
7.Add same amount of indicator in each titration.
